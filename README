Learning Project
This is a workspace for me to practice and learm good coding techniques.
    Project 1.
    A basic GUI setup using tkinter. I am attempting to follow clean coding practices
    gui.py
    Some issues during the project:
        - Making the radiobutton change states
        - Understanding methods in classes
        - Understanding loop protocol
        - passing radiobutton states to a different widget
        - Understanding the MainApp as a controller
        - Properly formatting code

    Project 2.
    Setting up my regression model code that can grab data from a csv and be accesable from shell.
    ui.py and operations.py
    Issues:
        - Calculating the R squared value correctly
        - Parsing bash options and switches
        - Being able to execute from shell
        - Formatting previously typed matrix code

    Project 3.
    A small script that will normalize decibel reading values to distance of 1 ft. I want this to be compatable with my regression model code.
    decibelnorm.py
    Issues:
        - Passing multiple arguments through argparse
        - Getting it to accept multiple columns of data
        - Requiring the data to come in pairs(decibels, distance)
        - Have it write to a .csv file?

    Project 4. 
    A few files to help me learn simple data structures in python.
    linkedlist.py and bst.py
    Issues:
        - Determining the child of a node
        - Using a recursive structure to set up BST
        - Allowing branching functionality in a linked list
