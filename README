Learning Project
This is a workspace for me to practice and learm good coding techniques.
    Project 1.
    A basic GUI setup using tkinter. I am attempting to follow clean coding practices
    Some issues during the project:
        - Making the radiobutton change states
        - Understanding methods in classes
        - Understanding loop protocol
        - passing radiobutton states to a different widget
        - Understanding the MainApp as a controller
