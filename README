Learning Project
This is a workspace for me to practice and learm good coding techniques.
    Project 1.
    A basic GUI setup using tkinter. I am attempting to follow clean coding practices
    gui.py
    Some issues during the project:
        - Making the radiobutton change states
        - Understanding methods in classes
        - Understanding loop protocol
        - passing radiobutton states to a different widget
        - Understanding the MainApp as a controller
        - Properly formatting code

    Project 2.
    Setting up my regression model code that can grab data from a csv and be accesable from shell.
    ui.py and operations.py
    Issues:
        - Calculating the R squared value correctly
        - Parsing bash options and switches
        - Being able to execute from shell
